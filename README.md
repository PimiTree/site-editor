# PHP Tempalte
## Manual site creating 

Some when in far-far future it will be layout-builder which uses native HTML + CSS way to build page. Maybe with JS code integration.

### Deploy (localhost only, windows only)
1. Install [mkcert] on your machine
2. Be sure your docker engine is run
3. From project root folder in terminal `cmd /c build-tempalte.bat` or just double-click on it 
4. add `127.0.0.1 php.template.local` to your HOSTS file

Notice! Certificates at `/dev/certs` are just a sample. Each machine requires own generation.
